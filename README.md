# About

This GitHub link contains the ENF-WHU audio recording dataset collected around Wuhan University campus, and the MATLAB programs for electronic network frequency (ENF) analysis in ENF-based audio forensic applications.

## ENF-WHU Dataset
- **Recording location:** classroom, campus path, meeting room, graduate student office, dormitory, library.
- **Environment diversity:** day/night, rainy/suny.
- **Recording device:** popular smartphone and voice recorder.
- **Duration:** 5~20 minutes
- **Format:** PCM WAVE
- **Quantization depth:** 16-bit
- **Channel:** mono
- **Sampling frequencuy:** 8000 Hz
- **Category:**
  1. H0: "O01~O10.wav" 10 real-world recordings without captured ENF. "01~40.wav" 40 segments under H0 are obtained by random cropping the 10 recordings. 
  2. H1: "001~130.wav" 130 real-world recordings with captured (noisy) ENF.
  3. H1_ref: "001_ref~130_ref.wav" the corresponding 130 reference ENF (noise-free) recorded directly from power main.
