### ENF Enhancement and Estimation

It contains our proposed ENF enhancement and estimation methods including
- Single-tone model based ENF enhancement method [3],
- Multi-tone harmonic model based enhancement and harmonic selection for robust ENF estimation [2],<br>

in comparison with the following existing works 

- Adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) method by [Q. Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2021 IEEE TIFS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220114),
- Multi-tone maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) by [Bykhovsky and Cohen 2013 IEEE TIFS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6482617),
- Multi-tone weighted maximum likelihood estimator (WMLE) by [Hajj-Ahmad <em>et al.</em> 2013 IEEE SPL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6557080),<br>

evaluated using both synthetic data and the real-world recordings from the ENF-WHU dataset.
